Dino Story
By: Aaron , Delin Shi

Chapter 1
---------
A long long time ago, a ferocious Tyrannosaurus Rex named Teresa lived
next to a river in a swampy, smelly jungle. According to her neighbor
Terry the Pterodactyl, Teresa was the meanest dinosaur in the whole
jungle. Teresa spent most of her time stomping through the dense
undergrowth, roaring at smaller dinos that got in her way.
